#include <QDialog>

//! The common status dialog.
/*!
    All this does is to display a simple dialog which
    can be blocking (the most common way), or just
    informational. The dialog can only be closed
    programatically. And must be by another thread if
    used blocking.
    the most common use is:
    in header: \code
    Stat *statdlg;
    \endcode
    in constructor: \code
    statdlg = 0;
    \endcode
    in the calling function: \code
// initiate a new thread to make a job the main thread need to wait for
// ie. a http request.
    conn->Command();
    statdlg = new Stat("type message here");
    statdlg->place();
    statdlg->exec();
    delete statdlg;
    statdlg = 0;
    \endcode
    in the job complete function: \code
    if(statdlg) statdlg->accept(); \endcode
