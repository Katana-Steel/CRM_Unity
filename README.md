# Customer Relations Management System- "Unity"

---

This project was my first major project consisting of a native client written in C++
and a web service component written in PHP

the goal was having a unified system for sales and customer relations. With email orders,
offers, and reminders to the sales unit.

The web service features access to a product catalog and as well as reporting.
And the client application would tie in to those services and display them for the sales chain, with
various levels of access, and the higher the users' access number the more access she has.
